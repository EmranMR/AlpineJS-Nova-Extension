# AlpineJS Extension for Nova

## Introduction

This extension finally provides the long overdue **[AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) Autocompletion** + **Snippets** in Nova!  
The **snippets** are extensible, so if you know any other handy snippets we could all benefit from, please feel free to fork the extension and edit the file located at (Definitions/Snippets/GeneralSnippets.js), edit and pull request? 😇

**_Good luck with your projects!_** 🚀

## Usage

- The Attribute autocompletion are triggered in the Tags.
- The snippets are triggered only in the HTML body to avoid confusion and name resolution issues.

## Prerequisites

- The extension works in **_HTML, Blade, PHP_** if you are using AlpineJS in any other syntax **please raise an issue** on Github and I will add them as soon as possible.

## Requirements

- There are no requirements for the extension apart from having a Nova v3.0+  
  _just plug and play_ 🚀
