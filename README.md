# AlpineJS Extension for Nova

## Introduction

This extension provides the **[AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev) Autocompletion** + **Snippets** to Nova Editor!

This extension has been inspired by [Jason Platts's **AMAZING** 💯 TailwindCSS Nova extension](https://github.com/jasonplatts/tailwindcss-nova-ext) and [Adrian Wilczyński's VSCode AlpineJS extension](https://github.com/AdrianWilczynski/AlpineIntelliSense). In fact I used the dictionary from Adrain's repo, I tidied it up a bit to suit this project, and then made an extension around it utilising the informations from there.

**_Good luck with your projects & I hope you find the extension helpful!_** 🚀

## Usage

- The Attribute Autocompletion are triggered in the Tags in supported languages.

- The extension works in
  - **HTML**
  - **Blade**
  - **PHP**
  - **HTML.ERB**

  - Looking for support in any **_other syntax_**? [**please raise an issue**](https://github.com/EmranMR/AlpineJS-Nova-Extension/issues) on GitHub and I will try to add them as soon as possible.
